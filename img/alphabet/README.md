####Color code
I chose which color the letters' backgrounds were depending on what kind of letter they were. Hopefully, this way, the user will be able to associate colors with a particular type of letter, and thus learn it faster. It should also help with the syllable block grammar lesson that'll come later on.

* Pink = baseline vowels
* Cyan = sideline vowels
* Green = basic consonants
* Yellow = double consonants
* Orange = double vowels
* Red = strong consonants
