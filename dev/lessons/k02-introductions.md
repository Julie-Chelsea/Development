####Introductions & 이다

####Introduction of 이다 (to be equation) and it's sentence structure
* In English, if you're introducing yourself, you'll say something like "I am Chelsea."
 * In Korean, it's even more straightforward than that. The literal translation of the introduction would be "I Chelsea" [show the 'am' being crossed out]
 * You could even think of it as "I = Chelsea", which takes us to our first verb: 이다 (to be equation). Don't worry, it'll make sense soon.

##### Sentence structure
* Slide 1
 * You see, in Korean, sentences work like Subject-Object-Verb/Adjective.
 * This is different from English, where it works like Subject-Verb-Object.
* Slide 2
 * [examples should have Subject, Object, Adjective, Verb indicated & highlighted]
 * In English, a sentence would look like:
  *Ex1: Jane bought a duck.
* But in Korean, the sentence would be structured like:
 * Jane (a) duck bought.
* Slide 3
 * In Korean, to make it clear who/what is the subject and object, there are topic particles that go on words.
 * [Example of that sentence in Korean structure, but with 이/가 & 은/는 attached to the ends of the words of Jane & duck.]
 * 이, 가, 은, & 는 are all topic particles, but they are used in pairs: 이/가 & 은/는.
* Slide 4
 * When a word ends in a consonant, you use 이 & 은 from the respective pairs
 * When a word ends in a vowel, you use 가 & 는 from the respective pairs
 * So what's the difference between 이/가 & 은/는?
* Slide 5
 * 은/는 is used on the Subject part of the sentence, and is used when you're starting a conversation, or switching conversation topic.
 * 이/가, on the other hand, can be used on both the Subject and the Object. But it can only be used on the subject if it is already established as the subject, through the usage of 은/는 in its introduction.
* Slide 6
 * So when you're introducing yourself, you'd have to use 은/는 attached to your name to indicate that you are talking about yourself.
