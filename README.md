Languages (Temporary name)
==========================
This is the first project that we are doing together. It will be a free, intuitive website that allows a user to learn a language of their choice.

The first languages that we're going to be doing are Korean and Japanese.

How it'll work
------------------------
The user will sign up by first choosing the language that they want to learn in (only American and British English for starters), then they will choose the the language that they want to learn. The user will offer details such as age, occupation, and location, so that we can match them to word sets and create an experience that will best fit them.

After that, the user will be able to select different methods of learning. Currently, we plan to incluude the following methods:
* Flashcards
* Fill-in-the-blank
* Animations
* Entertainment
* Quizzes

We will be doing research to decide how and when to test users and have them review previous material. And to decide how to reward the user for their successes.

Note that the current URL will only be used until we make significant progress in our project, and find a name for it. Then we will get a URL that's dedicated to it.

(More to come later)
