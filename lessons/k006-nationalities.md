## Nationalities & Languages

#### Introduction to lesson
* One of the first things that someone would ask you is where you're from. Thus, in this lesson, you will learn how to say which language(s) you speak, and say some countries' names.
* First, let's learn how to say the names of ten countries. 

#### Countries
* Slide 1
  * One thing you may notice, is that many of the countries have the syllable '국' (guk), pronounced "gook", at the end of them. 국 means nation in Korean.
* Word 1: South Korea 한국 Hangook
* Word 2: Republic of South Korea 대한민국
	* This is another way that Koreans refer to their country. This is the patriotic way of referring to it.
	* You're most likely to hear Koreans cheering this during the World Cup season.
* Word 3: United States 미국
* Word 4: United Kingdom 영국
* Word 5: China 중국
* Word 6: Japan 일본
* Word 7: Spain 스페인
* Word 8: France 프랑스
* Word 9: Canada 캐나다
* Word 10: Russia 러시아
* Word 11: Mexico 맥시코

#### Nationalities
* Slide 1
	* Saying that you are a certain nationality is surprisingly simple in Korean, it's basically just:
	* [Subject]+ ~은/는 + [country] + 사람 + ~이에요.
	* 사람 means "person" or "people"
	* So if I wanted to say "I am American" in Korean, I would say:
	* 저는 미국 사람이에요.
* Slide 2
	* 저는 미국 사람이에요.
	* Side note: If you were to translate this literally, you would get "I = American person."
	* But, you'll realize, as we go forth with learning more Korean, that literal translations aren't always reliable in understanding the meaning of phrases.
* Word 12: 사람 = Saram = person, people

#### Languages - Intro
* Slide 1
	* Luckily, it's also very easy to know how to say a language name in Korean if you already know the country name. There's a simple formula:
	* [Country] + 어 = Language name.
	* So let's say that I want to say the language 'Korean', it would look like:
	* [Show animation constructing the word] 한국 + 어 = 한국어
* Word 13: 한국어 = Han-guk-oh Korean 
* Slide 2
	* That is the simple formula, but be cautious, because just like when we speak in English, we wouldn't say that a person speaks American as their language, nFrenchor would we say that someone speaks British as their language.
	* Thus, 'English' in Korean is 영어. This is one of the biggest exceptions to the formula, and also the most important one to know, since you speak English.
* Word 14: 영어= Yong-oh = English

#### Languages
* Word 15: Chinese = 중국어 = Joong-guk-oh
* Word 16: Japanese = 일본어 = Il-bon-oh
* Word 17: Spanish = 스페인어 = Su-peh-in-oh 
* Word 18: French = 프랑스어 = Pu-rang-su-oh
* Word 19: Russian = 러시아어 = Ruh-si-a-oh

####Closing notes
* Also be careful not to confuse the word for a language with describing something that is from that country.
* For instance, if you were trying to say "Chinese food", you wouldn't use "중국어" to say "Chinese," because 중국어 is a language, not an adjective.
* Instead, you can use 중국 as an adjective as well as a noun. So you'd use 중국 to represent 'Chinese' in your phrase "Chinese food"
* As you progress through Peck, you'll get the opportunity to learn how to say many more countries and languages.
