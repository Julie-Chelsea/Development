##Greetings & Farewells

####Introduction to Lesson
* Slide 1
  * Greetings
  * In Korean, greetings aren't as simple as "Hello" and "Goodbye."
* Slide 2
  * But if you think about it, it's not that simple in English either.
  * We say "Hi", "Hello", "Hey", "Bye", etc. depending on who we're talking to.
* Slide 3
  * It's the same concept in Korea.
  * Words change depending on the context, but there's a more defined system in place in Korean. Verbs and adjectives are conjugated to express the level of respect that you are giving the subject.
* Slide 4
  * For instance, when talking to your friends in Korean, you'd use plain form or polite form, depending on how close you are.
  * But when talking to your teacher, you would use honorific form to show your respect, or polite form as the bare minimum.
* Slide 5
  * Let's start learning the core vocabulary.
  * In lessons, words will be presented in this format: [show a template of word presentation, with fields 'Word/Phrase', 'English definition', 'Romanization']
  
####Greetings
* Word 1: How are you?/Hello 안녕하세요?
  * Despite the fact that this word translates as 'How are you?' in English, it isn't used to ask people how they are doing.
  * It can be seen as small talk that you don't have to respond to.
  * In Korean, there's a way to ask how people are doing, which you will learn later. The distinction is useful, because you'll know when someone cares about your response, whereas it is questionable in English.
  * You'd say this when talking to strangers, teachers, elders, etc. Basically, you'd say this to anyone who isn't one of your friends.
* Word 2: Hi/Hey/Bye 안녕.
  * You'd say this when greeting a friend or sibling--anyone that you have a close relationship with.
  * Note that this can also be used as a way to say bye
* Word 3: I'm going 간다.
  * This is another way to say farewell to friends. This word is in plain form, which is usually used amongst siblings and friends.
  * Plain form, and other forms, will be defined more clearly later. But if you're curious, feel free to check out each of the words' profiles in the vocabulary list [animated graphic showing this] to have words and their forms explained further.
* Word 4: Bye 잘가
  * Another informal way of saying bye.
* Word 5: Goodbye (to the one staying) 안녕히 계세요.
  * This is used with anyone who isn't a friend or younger family member.
  * Its literal meaning is "stay well" [animate what each word part means].
* Word 6: Goodbye (to the one leaving) 안녕히 가세요.
  * Used with anyone who isn't a friend or younger family member.
  * Its literal meaning is "go well"
* Word 7: Good night (honorific) 안녕히 주무십시요.
  * Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, etc. can all be fulfilled with annyonghaseyo, but if you're about to go to sleep, or someone else is going to sleep, you could say 안녕히 주무십시요.
  * This is the formal way of saying it, so you'd say it to an older family member, stranger, etc. There's another way to wish friends or siblings good night, which is coming up next!
* Word 8: Good night (plain) 자.
  * Its literal meaning is "Sleep", and it is in plain form. You'd say it to friends or siblings.

####First meetings
* When you meet someone for the first time, you usually say hello, but then you may wrap up the conversation by saying ... 
* Word 9: Nice to meet you. 반갑습니다.
 * You'd say this to anyone that you meet for the first time, because you haven't established a relationship with them yet. Regardless of if you both become great friends in the first meeting, or if you're classmates, saying 'Nice to meet you' is commonplace.
* But wait a minute--in the conversation, you're going to have to let the other person know who you are, right?
* Right! That brings us to our very first verb and sentence structure, which will be introduced in the next lesson.
