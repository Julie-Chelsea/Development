##Greetings, Farewells, & Introductions

####Introduction to Lesson
* Slide 1
  * Greetings
  * In Korean, greetings aren't as simple as "Hello" and "Goodbye."
* Slide 2
  * But if you think about it, it's not that simple in English either.
  * We say "Hi", "Hello", "Hey", "Bye", etc. depending on who we're talking to.
* Slide 3
  * It's the same concept in Korea.
  * Words change depending on the context, but there's a more defined system in place in Korean. Verbs and adjectives are be conjugated to express the level of respect that you are giving the subject.
* Slide 4
  * For instance, when talking to your friends in Korean, you'd use plain form or polite form, depending on how close you are.
  * But when talking to your teacher, you would use honorific form to show your respect, or polite form as the bare minimum.
* Slide 5
  * Let's start learning the core vocabulary.
  * In lessons, words will be presented in this format: [show a template of word presentation, with fields 'Word/Phrase', 'English definition', 'Romanization']
  
####Greetings
* Word 1: How are you?/Hello
  * Despite the fact that this word translates as 'How are you?' in English, it isn't used to ask people how they are doing.
  * It can be seen as small talk that you don't have to respond to.
  * In Korean, there's a way to ask how people are doing, which you will learn later. The distinction is useful, because you'll know when someone cares about your response, whereas it is questionable in English.
  * You'd say this when talking to strangers, teachers, elders, etc. Basically, you'd say this to anyone who isn't one of your friends.
* Word 2: Hi/Hey/Bye
  * You'd say this when greeting a friend or sibling--anyone that you have a close relationship with.
  * Note that this can also be used as a way to say bye
* Word 3: I'm leaving
  * This is another way to say farewell to friends. This word is in plain form, which is usually used amongst family and friends.
  * Plain form, and other forms, will be defined more clearly later. But if you're curious, feel free to check out each of the words' profiles in the vocabulary list [animated graphic showing this] to have words and their forms explained further.
* Word 4: Bye
  * Another informal way of saying bye.
* Word 5: Goodbye (to the one staying)
  * This is used with anyone who isn't a friend or family member.
  * Its literal meaning is "stay well" [animate what each word part means].
* Word 6: Goodbye (to the one leaving)
  * Used with anyone who isn't a friend or family member.
  * Its literal meaning is "go well"
* Word 7: Good night (humble)
  * Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, etc. can all be fulfilled with annyong haseyo, but if you're about to go to sleep, or someone else is going to sleep, you'd say [korean word for goodnight].
  * This is the formal way of saying it, so you'd say it to an older family member, stranger, etc. There's another way to wish friends or siblings good night, which is coming up next!
* Word 8: Good night (plain)
  * Its literal meaning is "Sleep", and it is in plain form. You'd say it to friends or siblings.
