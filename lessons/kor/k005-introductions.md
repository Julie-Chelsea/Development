## 4과 Introductions & 이다

####Introduction of 이다 (to be equation) and it's sentence structure
* In English, if you're introducing yourself, you'll say something like "I am Chelsea."
 * In Korean, it's even more straightforward than that. The literal translation of the introduction would be "I Chelsea" [show the 'am' being crossed out]
 * You could even think of it as "I = Chelsea", which takes us to our first verb: 이다 (to be equation). Don't worry, it'll make sense soon.

##### Sentence structure
* Slide 1
 * You see, in Korean, sentences work like Subject-Object-Verb/Adjective.
 * This is different from English, where it works like Subject-Verb-Object.
* Slide 2
 * [examples should have Subject, Object, Adjective, Verb indicated & highlighted]
 * In English, a sentence would look like:
  *Ex1: Jane bought a book.
* But in Korean, the sentence would be structured like:
 * Jane (a) book bought.
* Slide 3
 * In Korean, to make it clear who/what is the subject and object, there are topic particles that go on words.
 * [Example of that sentence in Korean structure, but with 이/가 & 은/는 attached to the ends of the words of Jane & duck.]
 * 이, 가, 은, & 는 are all topic particles, but they are used in pairs: 이/가 & 은/는.
* Slide 4
 * When a word ends in a consonant, you use 이 & 은 from the respective pairs
 * When a word ends in a vowel, you use 가 & 는 from the respective pairs
 * So what's the difference between 이/가 & 은/는?
* Slide 5
 * 은/는 is used on the Subject part of the sentence, and is used when you're starting a conversation, or switching conversation topic.
 * 이/가, on the other hand, can be used on both the Subject and the Object. But it can only be used on the subject if it is already established as the subject, through the usage of 은/는 in its introduction.
* Slide 6
 * So when you're introducing yourself, you'd have to use 은/는 attached to your name to indicate that you are talking about yourself, and the conversation is switching to being about you.
* Slide 7
 * In Korean, there are two ways of saying I: 저 (humble) & 나 (plain)
 * 나 (na) is used between friends and other people that you have a close relationship with
 * 저 (juh) is used with everyone else, in order to show your respect.
  *  저 is used more often, so we will focus more on it than 나
 * 나는 첼시예요.
* Slide 8
 * [Animate this slide w/ english definition & romanizatiion below the korean phrase, & animate for clarification]
 * So if I'm introducing myself, I would either say 나는 첼시 (na-neun chel-si) or 저는 첼시예요 (juh-neun chel-si-ye-yo).
 *  는 is attached to  저 because  저 ends in a vowel.  첼시 is Chelsea in Korean. But where did the  예요 come from?
* Slide 9
 *  when 이다 is conjugated into its present polite form, it becomes ~이에요 (ee-eh-yo) (attached to words ending in a consonant) & ~예요 (ye-yo) (attached to words ending in a vowel).
 *  첼시 ends in a vowel, so I add ~예요 (yeyo)
 *  That's how we got 저는 첼시예요, which is the Korean equivalent of I = Chelsea.
* Slide 10
 * Notice that ~이에요 (ee-eh-yo) & ~예요 (ye-yo) are in polite form. That means, when I'd use it when introducing myself to someone who is my age or younger.
 * There's another way to introduce yourself that you can use with people who are older than you, or with people who you want to be more respectful to. That will come later, because it requires learning deferential form first, and we've just started with polite form!
 * Polite form is enough for now.
* Slide 11
 * This brings us to our first sentence structure:
  * |Subject|(~은/는) |Object|(~이에요/예요).
* Slide 12
 * If we go back to our first example of "Jane bought a book", we'd have to use 이/가 to indicate what/who the subject and objects are.
 * It'd look like 재인은 책이 샀어요. (Jae-ee-nun cheg-ee sa-ssuh-yo).
 * Here, we can see that Jane is the subject, the book is the object, and bought is the verb, because we know the general Korean sentence structure S-O-V(/A).
 * Don't worry about 샀어요 for now, we'll learn that verb and how to use past tense later on.
