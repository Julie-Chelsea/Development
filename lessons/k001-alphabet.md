## 1과 Alphabet I

#### Introduction to Lesson
* In the Korean alphabet, 한글 (Hangul), there are 40 letters.
* In this lesson, we'll learn the 9 basic consonants, 8 basic vowels, and 6 '-y' vowels. We'll learn the rest of the alphabet in the next lesson.

#### Syllable form 1: CV
* [Show diagram of CV forms]
* There are two CV forms, one that is vertical, and one that is horizontal. The consonant is in the same place regardless, though, so we will those first.

#### Basic consonants

* Letter 1: ㄱ = g, k
  * This letter primarily has a 'g' sound, but it can sometimes sound like a mix of the 'g' and 'k' sound as well
  * For instance, 한국 is pronounced "Hanguk." There are two ㄱ, but one sounds more like a 'k' rather than a 'g'
* Letter 2: ㄴ = n
* Letter 3: ㄷ = d
* Letter 4: ㄹ = r, l
  * This letter sounds like a mix of 'r' and 'l', but can change to being only an 'r' or 'l' sound based on what the word is
  * For instance, the name 'Lisa' translated into Korean is 리사, which is pronounced as "Lisa," not "Risa"
* Letter 5: ㅁ = m
* Letter 6: ㅂ = b, p
  * This letter sounds like a mix of 'b' and 'p'. It usually sounds like 'b', but there're some cases where it sounds like one over the other
  * For instance, in the word 김밥 = seaweed rice roll = gimbap, the second ㅂ sounds more like a 'p'
* Letter 7: ㅅ = s
  * This letter can sound like a 'sh' instead of 's' when combined with other letters.
  * For instance, 
* Letter 8: ㅇ = ng, no sound
  * This letter sounds like the 'ng' in words that end with '-ing'
  * This letter is quite interesting, because it's more often used as a place holder for a vowel.
  * In Korean, each syllable block must, at the very least, consist of one consonant and one vowel.
  * But let's say that you want to say "Ah" in Korean. You can't combine an 'a' sound with any other consonant to have the 'a' sound on its own.
  * That's why there's ㅇ, which has can be a silent, or null, consonant.
  * We will learn syllable blocks in further detail in another lesson!
* Letter 9: ㅈ = j, ch
  *  This letter often sounds more like 'j', but it can sometimes sound like a mix between the two
  *  For instance, if you recall, when you tell someone goodnight plainly, you can say 자 (Ja). But this can sound a lot more like 'Cha' than 'Ja'

#### Different letter writing styles

#### Basic vowels
* Slide 1
 * First, we will learn vowels that are written to the right of the consonant. We're going to call them 'sideline vowels,' because they go to the side.
* Letter 10: ㅏ = ah
* Letter 11: ㅔ = eh
* Letter 12: ㅐ = ae
* Letter 13: ㅓ = uh
* Letter 14: ㅣ= ee
* Slide 2
 * Now, let's learn about 'baseline vowels.' We're calling them that because they go below the consonant.
* Letter 15: ㅗ = oh
* Letter 16: ㅜ = oo
* Letter 17: ㅡ = eu
 * The sound of this vowel is like you're saying eugh while smiling.

#### '-y' vowels
* Vowels, a small additional line is added to the basic vowels to add a '-y' sound at the beginning of the vowels
* Letter 18: ㅑ = yah
* Letter 19: ㅖ = yeh
* Letter 20: ㅒ = yae
* Letter 21: ㅕ = yuh
* Letter 22: ㅛ = yoh
* Letter 23: ㅠ = yoo
